# Demo of using `ffmpeg` from Go

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/practicalgo/go-ffmpeg-demo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/practicalgo/go-ffmpeg-demo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This demo specifically shows how we can supply input and obtain output via using input and output pipes, respectively.

Currently, only supports Linux and MacOS, as I couldn't get the same command to work on Windows.
